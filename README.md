# Mentor-Mentee Marketplace API

I've written the mentor-mentee marketplace APIs using Python 3.9+ and FastAPI. This implementation provides a comprehensive solution with the following features:

## Key Components

1. **User Management**
   * Registration and authentication
   * User roles (mentor, mentee, admin)

2. **Profile Management**
   * Detailed mentor profiles with expertise areas, rates, and availability
   * Mentee profiles with goals, interests, and expertise level

3. **Mentorship Sessions**
   * Session creation and management
   * Status tracking (pending, approved, completed, rejected)

4. **Meeting Management**
   * Schedule and track meetings within sessions
   * Meeting status updates

5. **Review System**
   * Ratings and feedback for mentors and mentees

6. **Advanced Search Functionality**
   * Search mentors by expertise, rate, experience
   * Search mentees by interests and goals
   * Search sessions by various criteria

7. **Analytics**
   * Individual mentor/mentee statistics
   * Platform-wide analytics

## Technical Features

* **SQLAlchemy ORM** for database interactions
* **Pydantic models** for request/response validation
* **Comprehensive documentation** for all API endpoints
* **Type annotations** throughout for improved code quality
* **Pagination** support for list endpoints
* **Filtering options** on all collection endpoints
* **Proper error handling** with appropriate status codes

## Getting Started

To run this application:

1. Install dependencies:

```
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy pydantic passlib[bcrypt] email-validator
```

2. Run the server:

```
python app.py
```

3. Access the automatic API documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

This implementation uses SQLite for simplicity, but you can easily switch to PostgreSQL, MySQL, or another database by changing the DATABASE_URL configuration.

Suggestions and thoughts welcome!
